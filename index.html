<p class=p_one>Watercolor, also aquarelle, a diminutive of the Latin for water, is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. Watercolor refers to both the medium and the resulting artwork.</p>

<p class=p_one>The traditional and most common support—material to which the paint is applied—for watercolor paintings is paper. Other supports include papyrus, bark papers, plastics, vellum, or leather, fabric, wood, and canvas. Watercolor paper is often made entirely or partially with cotton, which gives a good texture and minimizes distortion when wet. Watercolors are usually translucent, and appear luminous because the pigments are laid down in a pure form with few fillers obscuring the pigment colors. Watercolors can also be made opaque by adding Chinese white.</p>

<p class=p_one>In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as brush painting or scroll painting. In Chinese, Korean, and Japanese painting it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns. India, Ethiopia, and other countries have long watercolor painting traditions as well. Fingerpainting with watercolor paints originated in mainland China.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Watercolor painting is extremely old, dating perhaps to the cave paintings of paleolithic Europe, and has been used for manuscript illustration since at least Egyptian times but especially in the European Middle Ages. However, its continuous history as an art medium begins with the Renaissance. The German Northern Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), who painted several fine botanical, wildlife, and landscape watercolors, is generally considered among the earliest exponents of watercolor. An important school of watercolor painting in Germany was led by Hans Bol (1534–1593) as part of the Dürer Renaissance.</p>

<p>Despite this early start, watercolors were generally used by Baroque easel painters only for sketches, copies or cartoons (full-scale design drawings). Notable early practitioners of watercolor painting were Van Dyck (during his stay in England), Claude Lorrain, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, and many Dutch and Flemish artists. However, botanical illustration and wildlife illustration perhaps form the oldest and most important traditions in watercolor painting. Botanical illustrations became popular during the Renaissance, both as hand-tinted woodblock illustrations in books or broadsheets and as tinted ink drawings on vellum or paper. Botanical artists have traditionally been some of the most exacting and accomplished watercolor painters, and even today, watercolors—with their unique ability to summarize, clarify, and idealize in full color—are used to illustrate scientific and museum publications. Wildlife illustration reached its peak in the 19th century with artists such as John James Audubon, and today many naturalist field guides are still illustrated with watercolor paintings.

<h2>Materials</h2>
<h3>Paint</h3>

<p>Watercolor paint consists of four principal ingredients:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pigments, natural or synthetic, mineral or organic.</li>
  <li>Gum arabic as a binder to hold the pigment in suspension and fix the pigment to the painting surface.</li>
  <li>Additives like glycerin, ox gall, honey, and preservatives to alter the viscosity, hiding, durability or color of the pigment and vehicle mixture.</li>
  <li>Solvent (water), the substance used to thin or dilute the paint for application, which evaporates when the paint hardens or dries.</li></ol>

<p>The term watermedia refers to any painting medium that uses water as a solvent and that can be applied with a brush, pen, or sprayer. This includes most inks, watercolors, temperas, caseins, gouaches, and modern acrylic paints.</p>

<p>The term watercolor refers to paints that use water-soluble, complex carbohydrates as a binder. Originally (in the 16th to 18th centuries), watercolor binders were sugars and/or hide glues, but since the 19th century, the preferred binder is natural gum arabic, with glycerin and/or honey as additives to improve plasticity and solubility of the binder, and with other chemicals added to improve product shelf life.</p>

<p>The term bodycolor refers to paint that is opaque rather than transparent. It usually refers to opaque watercolor, known as gouache. Modern acrylic paints are based on a completely different chemistry that uses water-soluble acrylic resin as a binder.</p>


<h3>Brush</h3>

<p>A brush consists of three parts: the tuft, the ferrule and the handle.</p>

<ul>
   <li>The tuft is a bundle of animal hairs or synthetic fibers tied tightly together at the base;</li>
   <li>The ferrule is a metal sleeve that surrounds the tuft, gives the tuft its cross sectional shape, provides mechanical support under pressure, and protects from water wearing down the glue joint between the trimmed, flat base of the tuft and the handle;</li>
   <li>The lacquered wood handle, which is typically shorter in a watercolor brush than in an oil painting brush, has a distinct shape—widest just behind the ferrule and tapering to the tip.</li></ul>

<p>When painting, painters typically hold the brush just behind the ferrule for the smoothest brushstrokes.<p>

<p>Major watercolor brush manufacturers include Daler-Rowney, Arches, Silver Brush Ltd, Black Velvet® series, Creative Mark, DaVinci, Escoda, Isabey, Raphael, Kolonok, Robert Simmons, and Winsor and Newton. As with papers and paints, it is common for retailers to commission brushes under their own label from an established manufacturer like Blick Art Materials, Cheap Joe's, Daniel Smith, and Utrecht. </p>


<h3>Paper</h3>

<p>Now, watercolor painters typically paint on paper specifically formulated for watermedia applications. Watercolor paper is essentially blotting paper marketed and sold as an art paper and, if unsized, can be used as a substitute for blotter. Lower end watercolor papers which may contain wood pulp resemble heavy paper, while higher end varieties are usually entirely cotton or linen content and more porous like blotter. Watercolor paper is traditionally torn and not cut.<p>

<p>Fine watermedia papers are manufactured under the brand names Arches, Canson, The Langton (The Langton Prestige), Strathmore, Winsor & Newton, Bockingford, Cartiera Magnani, Fabriano, Hahnemühle, Lanaquarelle, Millford, Saunders Waterford, and Zerkall. There has been a resurgence in handmade papers by Twinrocker, Velke Losiny, Ruscombe Mill, and St. Armand.<p>

<h2>Techniques</h2>
<p>Watercolor painting has the reputation of being quite demanding; it is more accurate to say that watercolor techniques are unique to watercolor. Unlike oil or acrylic painting, where the paints essentially stay where they are put and dry more or less in the form they are applied, water is an active and complex partner in the watercolor painting process, changing both the absorbency and shape of the paper when it is wet and the outlines and appearance of the paint as it dries. The difficulty in watercolor painting is almost entirely in learning how to anticipate and leverage the behavior of water, rather than attempting to control or dominate it.<p>

<p>Many difficulties occur because watercolor paints do not have high hiding power, so previous efforts cannot simply be painted over; and the paper support is both absorbent and delicate, so the paints cannot simply be scraped off, like oil paint from a canvas, but must be laboriously (and often only partially) lifted by rewetting and blotting. This often induces in student painters a pronounced and inhibiting anxiety about making an irreversible mistake. Watercolor has a longstanding association with drawing or engraving, and the common procedure to curtail such mistakes is to make a precise, faint outline drawing in pencil of the subject to be painted, to use small brushes, and to paint limited areas of the painting only after all adjacent paint areas have completely dried.</p>

<h3>Washes and Glazes</h3>
<p>Basic watercolor technique includes washes and glazes. In watercolors, a wash is the application of diluted paint in a manner that disguises or effaces individual brush strokes to produce a unified area of color. Typically, this might be a light blue wash for the sky. There are many techniques to produce an acceptable wash, but the student method is to tilt the paper surface so that the top of the wash area is higher than the bottom, then to apply the paint in a series of even, horizontal brush strokes in a downward sequence, each stroke just overlapping the stroke above to pull downward the excess paint or water, and finally wicking up the excess paint from the last stroke using a paper towel or the tip of a moist brush. This produces an airy, translucent color effect unique to watercolors, especially when a granulating or flocculating pigment is used. Washes can be "graded" or "graduated" by adding more prediluted paint or water to the mixture used in successive brush strokes, which darkens or lightens the wash from start to finish. "Variegated" washes, which blend two or more paint colors, can also be used, for example as a wash with areas of blue and perhaps some red or orange for a sky at sunrise or sunset.</p>

<p>A glaze is the application of one paint color over a previous paint layer, with the new paint layer at a dilution sufficient to allow the first color to show through. Glazes are used to mix two or more colors, to adjust a color, or to produce an extremely homogenous, smooth color surface or a controlled but delicate color transition. The last technique requires the first layer to be a highly diluted consistency of paint; this paint layer dissolves the surface sizing of the paper and loosens the cellulose tufts in the pulp. Subsequent layers are applied at increasingly heavier concentrations, always using a small round brush, only after the previous paint application has completely dried. Each new layer is used to refine the color transitions or to efface visible irregularities in the existing color. Painters who use this technique may apply 100 glazes or more to create a single painting. This method is currently very popular for painting high contrast, intricate subjects, in particular colorful blossoms in crystal vases brightly illuminated by direct sunlight. The glazing method also works exceptionally well in watercolor portraiture, allowing the artist to depict complex flesh tones effectively.</p>

<h3> Wet in Wet</h3>
<p>Wet in wet includes any application of paint or water to an area of the painting that is already wet with either paint or water. In general, wet in wet is one of the most distinctive features of watercolor painting and the technique that produces a striking painterly effect.</p>

<p>The essential idea is to wet the entire sheet of paper, laid flat, until the surface no longer wicks up water but lets it sit on the surface, then to plunge in with a large brush saturated with paint. This is normally done to define the large areas of the painting with irregularly defined color, which is then sharpened and refined with more controlled painting as the paper (and preceding paint) dries.</p>

<h3>Dry Brush</h3>
<p>At the other extreme from wet in wet techniques, drybrush is the watercolor painting technique for precision and control, supremely exemplified in many botanical paintings and in the drybrush watercolors of Andrew Wyeth. Raw (undiluted) paint is picked up with a premoistened, small brush (usually a #4 or smaller), and then applied to the paper with small hatching or crisscrossing brushstrokes. The brush tip must be wetted but not overcharged with paint, and the paint must be just fluid enough to transfer to the paper with slight pressure and without dissolving the paint layer underneath. The goal is to build up or mix the paint colors with short precise touches that blend to avoid the appearance of pointillism. The cumulative effect is objective, textural, and highly controlled, with the strongest possible value contrasts in the medium. Often it is impossible to distinguish a good drybrush watercolor from a color photograph or oil painting, and many drybrush watercolors are varnished or lacquered after they are completed to enhance this resemblance.</p>

<h3>Diluting and mixing watercolor paints</h3>
<p>When using watercolors, it is important to use the full range of paint consistency. The densest possible color is obtained by using the paint as it comes from the tube. The lightest color is obtained by using paint heavily diluted with water, or applied to the paper and then blotted away with a paper towel. Generally, paint directly from the tube should be used only with drybrush application: if the paint is used to completely cover the paper it typically dries to a dull, leathery appearance (called bronzing). Usually one part tube paint must be diluted with 2 to 3 parts water to eliminate bronzing in paint applied with a large brush to dry paper; with 4 to 6 parts water to produce the most saturated color; and with still more water to produce delicate tints of color and to enhance pigment textures (granulation or flocculation). The main point is to take advantage of the complete range of paint effects that are produced at different paint consistencies.</p>

<h3>Minimal palettes</h3>
<p>Palette is also the term for a specific selection of paints (or "colors"). Though commercial watercolor brands typically include up to 100 or more paint colors in tubes, subtractive pigment mixtures can produce a complete range of colors from a small number of specific paints. Indeed, as a matter of economy, convenience, or technique, painters have often preferred palettes comprising the smallest practical selection of paints.</p>

<p>The smallest practical palette consists of one dark neutral paint, typically including a carbon black pigment or, in works before 1800, a sepia ink. As this single paint can only communicate value gradations from full strength (dark) to white paper, it produces monochrome images, often supplemented and sharpened by an underdrawing or additions in pen and ink.</p>

<h2>Famous Contemporary Artists</h2>

  <h3>Sukran Moral</h3>
  <p> a woman who is not afraid to shock and speak her mind among the conservatives. Although her watercolor art perhaps does not have a big part in her practice, it is as provocative as her performances, installations, videos and poetry. Şükran Moral’s work tackles everything out of order, or norms of the acceptable: immigrants, transsexuals, prostitutes, mentally ill. Her ideas are deeply rooted in feminism and the way religion affects women in her country, and herself in particular.</p>

  <h3>Larry Bell</h3>
  <p>Perhaps most famous for his sculptures, Larry Bell also does elaborated works on paper, using mixed media and watercolors too. These are often inspired by his leanings toward Abstract Expressionism, as they depict geometric compositions and stand right next to his geometric compositions in three-dimensional form, known as Cube sculptures. Larry Bell also introduced “vapor drawings” and “mirage works”, which involve the use of thin film deposition technology and the colouring sheets of various paper materials, strips of PET and laminate film. Very often, these works are squared, with the drawing occupying a small portion of their surface.</p>

  <h3>Don Bachardy</h3>
  <p>When someone says Don Bachardy, many people instantly think “Hollywood”. It is the artist’s most famous collection of watercolor art, which features portraits of the most familiar faces of the biggest movie industry in the world. He started his career in the midst of Abstract Expressionism too, guiding his portraiture towards figurative painting of great visual impact. Ever since, Don Bachardy has been managing to transmit powerful emotions through the faces of many who were willing to sit for him, those often being pain, suffering, even anguish. This is all emphasised by a rather bold use of watercolors, in a manner that has turned this artist into one of the best in the field.</p>

  <h3>Cecily Brown</h3>
  <p>Highly abstract and representational at the same time, the art of Cecily Brown incorporates nudes and figures immersed in rich colors and expressive brushstrokes. It sometimes takes a viewer a while to understand what they’re seeing, because of an apparent constant flow of colors, forms, lines. Cecily Brown is a painter who works on canvas and paper, and produces prints as well. Her watercolor art seems to be more focused on natural topics, animals, hares, perhaps inspired by Dürer, they tend to be simpler in color but less figurative in depiction, giving a sense of ambiguity, a chaos that somehow resides in harmony of colors.</p>

 <h3>Dima Rebus</h3>
  <p>On the dark side of watercolor art lives Dima Rebus, a young artist born in Russia. His works are, to say the least, unsettling: floating between reality and surreality, they depict humans and their eerie situations, accompanied by often cheeky titles that evoke the contemporary times we live in. Dima Rebus creates artwork for himself, but also does illustrations for magazines and publishing houses: just recently, one of his works became the image of National Geographic film Saints & Strangers. His technique is impeccable, extremely detailed and thought-provoking, inspired at times by his Russian roots.</p>

  <h3>Nadine Faraj</h3>
  <p>Scenery of sex is most probably the oldest topic in history of art, but in the case of Nadine Faraj, it is turned into watercolor pieces that aim to add a more humane note to it. This technique is the artist’s main focus, as her spilled colors float over paper, forming nude bodies engaged in erotic intercourse or simply being. Their provocative note ends up in the background, while the very characteristics of watercolors serve the whole narrative with some sensitivity, sensuality, a more intimate approach. These artworks by Nadine Faraj can now be seen all over the world, recognized for their unique visual ambivalence in depicting sex and sexuality.</p>

  <h3>Lourdes Sanchez</h3>
  <p>A swarm of flowers, some looking like mere ink stains, others evoking retro designs of wallpapers; patterns of color, saturated stripes, drops and circles, quite inspired by design. That’s how one would describe the art of Lourdes Sanchez, a Cuban-born artist and contemporary textile art designer currently residing in Brooklyn. According to her website, the artist is now focusing on fine art painting, although her watercolors are the ones having everyone going nuts over her work, wanting it to hang on their walls so desperately. Lourdes Sanchez is beautifully poetic, serene and incredibly capable to transmit all that through sometimes quite narrow palette.</p>

  <h3>Amy Park</h3>
  <p>If you’re looking for watercolor artist depicting iconic architecture, you can stop right here, since you’ve found the perfect one. Amy Park is known for being an expert on the topic, with her large scale works executed to perfection. Among her subjects, there are Donald Judd’s structures in Marfa, curiously designed houses across California, examples of Modernist architecture, New York City trademark urban landscape, and much more. Amy Park’s watercolors are based on her own photographs of these major landmarks and skyscrapers, and it is simply captivating how she managed to paint them with such accuracy.</p>

  <h3>Antonio Calderara</h3>
  <p>A self-taught Modernist painter, Italian artist Antonio Calderara was also a draftsman and a graphic designer. He is known for his non-figurative imagery, inspired by the works of Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian and Josef Albers, thus it is based on geometric abstract art which relies on the power of color field painting as well. His two-dimensional squares and serigraph works became the artist’s only practice after his participation at the 1959 Venice Biennale. As a watercolor artist, Antonio Calderara employs the same visual ideas, through works on paper and cardboard.</p>
